      <p>Images of usability is a theory about usability. It states that there are six definitions or images rather, of usability. Each of these images provide a partial but different view of usability and can be used to generate complementary insight about the usability of systems.</p>
      <p>Universal usability seeks to make a system universally easy to use. <em>Situational usability</em> states that the usability is equivalent to the quality-in-use of a system in a specific use situation. <em>Perceived usability</em> is about the users subjective experience with the interaction. <em>Hedonic usability</em> is about the joy of use and emotions related to the interaction. <em>Organizational usability</em> usability implies groups of people working together. <em>Cultural usability</em> states that the usability of a product is dependant on the users cultural background.</p>
      <p>Collectively these images can give you a wider scope when it comes to usability testing and make sure that you acknowledge that your users can assume different images.</p>
