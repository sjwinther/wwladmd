      <p>A usability test is a user test of the usability or ease of use something. The usability of a product is a part of the overall user experience. This can include websites, applications, services and anything else that requires user interaction.</p>
      <p>A usability test seeks to identify problems or confusion within the product. It is typically observed by a researcher, and if multiple users experience the same problems, it can lead to improvement suggestions.</p>
      <p>Usability tests incorporate methods such as card sorting, user surveys, gaze tracking and other tools that gather input from users.</p>
      <p>Jakob Nielsen and Don Norman are regarded as experts within the field.</p>
