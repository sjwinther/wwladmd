          It’s not enough that we build products that function, that are understandable and usable, we also need to build products that bring joy and excitement, pleasure and fun, and yes, beauty to people’s lives. – Don Norman

        <p>User experience design (UX) is a practice within digital design. It seeks to enhance the user satisfaction in a product or service through bettering details within usability, accesbility, pleasure, aesthetics and so forth. Alas it does not only seek to improve the efficiency and ease of use of a product, it also seeks to make the interaction more enjoyable.</p>
        <p>It encompasses and extends traditional HCI and incorporates design elements such as visual design, information architecture, interaction design and formerly mentioned usability.</p>
        <p>User experience design processes often include wireframes, low- and high fidelity prototypes and mockups, personas based on the users and scenarios.</p>
        <p>Jakob Nielsen and Don Norman are regarded as experts within the field.</p>

        <h2>UX in industry</h2>
        <a href="http://1508.dk/cases/moment/" target="_blank">1508 project example</a>
        <p>1508 developed a business concept in relation to on-boarding in cooperation with Moment - easier transition to a new workplace.</p>
        <p>The employees evaluate their own performance and the employers evaluate them as well.
        Information from the evaluations is actively used in correlation with a conversation between employer and employee. A number that represents the efficiency of the on-boarding of new employees is granted. This number can be compared with companies in other fields. All data is gathered online, so the companies can compare.</p>
        <p>The on-boarding experience is the result of user integration in design. The process include hypothesis-driven and experimental assumptions, quick-n-dirty testing, design-thinking principles, service-design methodologies and problem- & object oriented workflow.</p>

        <h2>UX at DMD</h2>
        <p>In a bachelor project by a couple of DMD students they investigated how they could design a service that would make pet owners feel safe about letting other people, whom they met through an online service,  take care of their pets. In this project they emphasized the importance of paying attention the user experience and how they could influence the experience their users might have, with such a site, in order to make them trust the other users and the service. The project was co-developed with actual pet owners and their insights was the main driver of the design process.</p>
